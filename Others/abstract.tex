This report aims to bring the results obtained, through the projects and studies carried out during the training course in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. And demonstrate how valuable, challenging and rewarding that period was. The knowledge derived from these activities provided the formation of a Specialist in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, with an understanding of the tools used for modeling, simulation and real construction of these systems, about how statistical studies are applied to analyze projects, and to know how to elaborate the project. planning, direct the execution and deliver the results to the clients of the proposed projects.
